If you make money from the use of or find this program helpful and interesting, you can support me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/StroepWafel). Your support is completely optional, but it helps me keep building tools like this — and maybe one day, turn it into my full-time job!

## Commands

### !queue

The default command to queue a song is `!queue <VIDEO_ID>`, where `<VIDEO_ID>` is the ID for the YouTube music video (everything after `?v=`). The command listener (default `!`) and command (default `queue`) can be changed in the [config](#config-documentation) if desired.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>By default, this command only works with IDs of videos that are on YouTube Music; regular videos will not play. This is because YouTube blocks links in livestream chats<!-- if the streamer has `Block links` enabled -->.

> [!WARNING]
> This Program is known to not work on linux, I am working on this, but it is not my main priority. if you have gotten it to work on linux without removing any functionality, you can create a PR, and I will review it.
